                    <h2>Gas Burner Won’t Ignite</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Gas burners work with an internal igniter which lights a small shot of gas released 
                        through a valve. Sometimes you turn the handle to ignite the burner, and all you hear is 
                        clicking – no flame. The most likely culprit is food debris. The food debris can get 
                        lodged in the pilot or the igniter. It can even get lodged deep in the burner assembly.<br/><br/>

                        Some ignition systems work via a spark, meaning the flip of a switch is supposed to 
                        create the spark that ignites the flame. In addition to the above problems, the culprit 
                        could be a faulty spark ignition switch. When this happens, you’ll have to have it 
                        replaced.

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>You can experience the same types of problems with electric stoves – they just have 
                        different origins. If the electric element doesn’t heat, the element itself may have 
                        gone bad. If you have a plug-in element, the problem could be with the terminal block where 
                        it plugs into the range top. Similarly, you could be experiencing a failure of the element 
                        control switch.<br/><br/>

                        With smooth-top models, sometimes the element limiter is the culprit. Smooth-top models 
                        feature a radiant or halogen element mounted beneath glass with a resistance wire that 
                        generates heat to the element. The element limiter shuts down the power to protect against 
                        over-heating. So, if your element won’t heat up, the limiter may be sensing too much heat, 
                        signifying its failure.</p>

                        the issue is typically a defective burner control switch, which is the mechanism for 
                        controlling the temperature. However, you may also be experiencing electrical problems

                        <p>The inside of an oven heats up the same way the range top does, by way of elements. 
                        As with the cooktop, you can experience problems with how the element receives electricity for 
                        heating or even with the element itself. Once you’ve turned on the oven, the element should glow 
                        red. If it doesn’t, you may have to replace one or both.</p>

                        allotted time. With this situation, the problem can be the same with both a gas and electric 
                        oven – the temperature sensor. If this sensor isn’t properly recording the internal temperature 
                        of the oven, then said oven won’t heat correctly.<br/><br/>

                        One cause of this problem is the position of the sensor. It may have gotten knocked against 
                        the side of the wall, which makes the sensor think the inside is hotter than it really is. 
                        However, the sensor can also fail – in that case, you’ll need a new sensor.<br/><br/>
                            
                        A non-functioning range or oven is a frustrating experience. Because of the gas or electrical

                        How to fix it: All you have to do is take out all of the food from the fridge, unplug the 
                        appliance, and wait for it to completely defrost. If you are experiencing the same issues 
                        after defrosting your fringe, the evaporator is most likely damaged and in need of a

                        <p>If you’ve got a smelly washing machine, it is probably the result of a build-up of bacteria 
                        and grime in your washing machine. This is often caused by only using cold washes and detergent 
                        getting left over after a cycle, which over time turns into grime and starts to smell. To get 
                        rid of the smells, run your washing machine on a cycle when it is empty on the hottest setting 
                        possible. Nine times out of ten, this will remove the smell. To avoid this happening again, it’s a 
                        good idea to give your washing machine a regular clean.</p>

                            How to fix it: First thing’s first – stop the water supply by turning the shut-off valve. 
                            To melt the accumulated ice, you’ll need to turn off the refrigerator’s power for at least two 
                            hours. If you want to speed up the melting process, you can use a blow dryer or apply hot 
                            water – whatever you find most convenient.</p>

                        <h2>Tripped ice bucket sensor</h2>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Modern refrigerators have a special sensor that detects the ice bucket. 
                            As time passes, ice can build up between the bin and the appliance’s wall, pushing the bucket 
                            out of its place, which trips the above-mentioned sensor. When this happens, your refrigerator 
                            indicates that the bin is missing and stops producing ice.<br/><br/>

                            How to fix it: Again, the solution to this problem involves a lot of melting and soaking 
                            up excess water. First, take out the ice bin and let it defrost for a few hours. You can speed 
                            up the process by giving it a hot bath. Then, make sure to remove all of the accumulated ice 
                            from the sensor. It’s best to do this manually. Finally, soak up any excess moisture with a clean 
                            towel and place the bin back inside.</p>

                        <p>People tend to take their appliances for granted. You may spend a lot of time

                        they don’t, that can leave you in a bind for completing your cooking tasks. Below 
                        are some of the common problems that can affect your oven.</p>
