                    <h2>Washing Machine Moves Around</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>
                            It’s normal for your washing machine to vibrate and move slightly during a washing 
                            cycle, but when it starts to bounce around loudly or move a lot, this indicates 
                            something is wrong with your washing machine that will need to be repaired.<br/><br/>

                            The most common cause of this problem is when the washing machine isn’t level on the 
                            ground. To fix this problem, you can grab a bubble level and check if your washing 
                            machine is level; if not, adjust the legs so that it is. If that isn’t the cause of 
                            the problem, the next likely cause is faulty suspension rods. Sometimes they become 
                            disconnected, and this will cause your washing machine to bounce around a lot. If the 
                            suspension rods are defective, they need to be replaced.
                        </p>

                        <p>The next common problem is when the washing machine starts to make loud noises when operating. 
                        This is caused most of the time by something in your washing machine like a coin or other debris 
                        bouncing around. All you need to do to stop this from happening is remove the item from the washer.<br/><br/>

                        It can also be caused by a faulty internal component, such as the motor, but to fix this, you’ll need 
                        to contact a qualified technician.

                        something in your washer that shouldn’t be there, like a piece of sharp plastic. It can 
                        also be caused by your clothes getting caught up around the center pole, so make sure your 
                        clothes and linens are properly placed in the washer.

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>If your washing machine doesn’t drain properly, it’s probably caused by a blockage 
                        somewhere within the washing machine’s draining system. The most likely component that 
                        is affected is the filter, as often filters get clogged up with debris. All you need 
                        to do is check the filter for blockages, and if you find any, unblock it. To avoid this 
                        happening in the future, it’s a good idea to give the filter a regular cleanout.

                    <h2>Washing Machine Won’t Spin</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>If your washing machine isn’t spinning, it can be either something simple you can fix 
                            yourself or something more complicated that will require a technician to fix.<br/><br/>

                            Let’s start with the simple cause. The most common issue is when the washer is 
                            filled up with too many clothes or linens, which can stop the washer from being able to 
                            spin around. So, check that it isn’t overloaded, and if it is, remove some stuff from it.<br/><br/>
                            
                            If that doesn’t fix the problem, it is most likely caused by a faulty internal component, 
                            such as the motor or the control board. To fix these components or replace them, you need 
                            to take the panels off the washer so you can check them with a multimeter. If they are faulty, 
                            they will need to be replaced. These repairs require having the right tools, so you’ll probably 
                            have to call a qualified technician to do it for you.</p>

                    <h2>Washing Machine Doesn’t Fill with Water</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>If your washing machine isn’t filling up with enough water or isn’t filling with water at 
                        all, the best place to start is to check the water hoses, which can sometimes get blocked or 
                        kinked.

                        To do this, you simply need to locate the hoses and check them for blockages or kinks, and 
                        if you find any, fix the hose so that the water can freely flow through them. You should 
                        also check that water is coming through the taps, and if not, it might be caused by your 
                        water being turned off at the main, or you might be experiencing an outage.</p>

                        <p>If your washing machine’s door doesn’t open, it is usually caused by your washer still 
                        being filled with water, which stops the door latch from opening. To get the door open, 
                        turn your washing machine on to a new cycle, and this should drain the washing machine 
                        and let you open the door. Once you’ve got the door open, you’ll need to check the drain 
                        and filter to ensure there is no blockage. If your door won’t open even when there is no 
                        water in it, it could be caused by a faulty door switch or the control board. These internal 
                        elements will need to be checked with a multimeter and then repaired or replaced, so you’ll 
                        need to call a technician to do it for you.</p>

                        <p>If you’ve got a smelly washing machine, it is probably the result of a build-up of bacteria 
                        and grime in your washing machine. This is often caused by only using cold washes and detergent 
                        getting left over after a cycle, which over time turns into grime and starts to smell. To get 
                        rid of the smells, run your washing machine on a cycle when it is empty on the hottest setting 
                        possible. Nine times out of ten, this will remove the smell. To avoid this happening again, it’s a 
                        good idea to give your washing machine a regular clean.</p>

                            <p>If your washing machine doesn’t turn on or stops during a cycle, it is most likely caused 
                            by a problem with the power source. To fix this problem, you need to check that the circuit 
                            breaker responsible for powering your washer is turned on, and if not, turn it back on – if 
                            the problem keeps happening it will need to be repaired. If the circuit breaker is ok, then 
                            plug your washer into another power outlet and see if it works – if it does, this means the 
                            power outlet is faulty and needs to be repaired.</p>

                            and the power. You will then have to manually drain the washer before unblocking the pipe and

                        <p>Refrigerator is one of the most common electric appliances found in homes. 
                        It keeps your food cool and fresh and prevents it from spoiling. A properly 
                        functioning refrigerator has become an important part of our daily routines. 
                        However, like any other electric appliance, you might face a few refrigerator 
                        problems due to rigorous usage.</p>

                        <p>People tend to take their appliances for granted. You may spend a lot of time 
                        choosing just the correct stove and even give it a good cleaning regularly. However, 
                        for the most part, you want your range and oven to work when you need them. When 
                        they don’t, that can leave you in a bind for completing your cooking tasks. Below 
                        are some of the common problems that can affect your oven.</p>
