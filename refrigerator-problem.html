                    <h2>Clogged defrost drain</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>This is the most common reason behind a leaking refrigerator. Basically, what happens is that 
                            nasty debris and food bits get stuck in the drain hose, which leads to a clog. Over time, ice 
                            starts to build up and you end up with a huge water puddle.<br/><br/>

                            How to fix it: The first thing that you can do is to clear up the drain from the inside of 
                            the fridge, using only hot water. If this doesn’t work, get a pipe cleaner and try to push 
                            out the nasty buildup. As a last resort, you can also try to manually remove the debris 
                            by pulling the appliance out and cleaning the rubber check valve located on the back service 
                            panel. Remove the debris with soap and warm water and install the valve back.

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>A clogged or frozen water supply can also be the reason for a leaking fridge. Again, this is a 
                            very common refrigerator problem and you don’t have much control over it in terms of prevention.<br/><br/>

                            How to fix it:
                            First, you have to unplug the appliance from the power socket. Then, you need to find the 
                            shut-off valve – it will be most likely installed underneath your kitchen sink. Make sure 
                            that the valve is completely closed and inspect the plastic supply line for clogs or leaks. 
                            In case of a tear, you’ll have to replace the water supply line. If everything seems OK, 
                            but you are still experiencing leaking, you are dealing with an ice blocage. In this scenario, 
                            what you need to do is leave the refrigerator unplugged so the ice can melt.

                            How to fix it: Just plug-in back the appliance to the socket – duh.

                        How to fix it: Unplug the refrigerator from the power supply and pull it out. Locate the

                            form around the evaporator and back freezer compartment wall, resulting in your freezer 
                            not cooling properly.<br/><br/>

                            How to fix it: Fixing a faulty refrigerator system is not an easy task. Your best bet is 
                            to call a technician to fix it for you.

                        rid of the smells, run your washing machine on a cycle when it is empty on the hottest setting 
                        possible. Nine times out of ten, this will remove the smell. To avoid this happening again, it’s a 
                        good idea to give your washing machine a regular clean.</p>

                            How to fix it: First thing’s first – stop the water supply by turning the shut-off valve. 
                            To melt the accumulated ice, you’ll need to turn off the refrigerator’s power for at least two 
                            hours. If you want to speed up the melting process, you can use a blow dryer or apply hot

                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Modern refrigerators have a special sensor that detects the ice bucket. 
                            As time passes, ice can build up between the bin and the appliance’s wall, pushing the bucket 
                            out of its place, which trips the above-mentioned sensor. When this happens, your refrigerator 
                            indicates that the bin is missing and stops producing ice.<br/><br/>

                            How to fix it: Again, the solution to this problem involves a lot of melting and soaking 
                            up excess water. First, take out the ice bin and let it defrost for a few hours. You can speed 
                            up the process by giving it a hot bath. Then, make sure to remove all of the accumulated ice 
                            from the sensor. It’s best to do this manually. Finally, soak up any excess moisture with a clean 
                            towel and place the bin back inside.</p>

                        <p>People tend to take their appliances for granted. You may spend a lot of time

                        they don’t, that can leave you in a bind for completing your cooking tasks. Below 
                        are some of the common problems that can affect your oven.</p>
